Input: [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
Output: 15
Explanation: Diagonals starting from the top row are:
- (0,0): 1+5+9=15
- (0,1): 2+6=8
- (0,2): 3=3
Diagonals starting from the leftmost column are:
- (1,0): 4+8=12
- (2,0): 7=7
The maximum sum is 15.

Input: [
  [9, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 1],
  [7, 1, 6]
]
Output: 16
Explanation: Maximum diagonal starts at (2,0) with sum 7+5+3=15
