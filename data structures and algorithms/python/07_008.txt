Input: prices = [2, 5, 1, 8, 3, 4, 6, 7], k = 3
Output: [5, 8, 8, 24, 18, 28]
Explanation:
Window [2, 5, 1] → max = 5, min = 1, product = 5
Window [5, 1, 8] → max = 8, min = 1, product = 8
Window [1, 8, 3] → max = 8, min = 1, product = 8
Window [8, 3, 4] → max = 8, min = 3, product = 24
Window [3, 4, 6] → max = 6, min = 3, product = 18
Window [4, 6, 7] → max = 7, min = 4, product = 28
