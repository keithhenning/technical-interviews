Input: 
target = 12
positions = [10, 8, 0, 5, 3]
speeds = [2, 4, 1, 1, 3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- Vehicle at position 10 with speed 2 reaches the target in (12-10)/2 = 1 time unit
- Vehicle at position 8 with speed 4 reaches the target in (12-8)/4 = 1 time unit (forms a convoy with the first vehicle)
- Vehicle at position 0 with speed 1 reaches the target in 12 time units (forms its own convoy)
- Vehicle at position 5 with speed 1 reaches the target in 7 time units (forms its own convoy)
- Vehicle at position 3 with speed 3 reaches the target in 3 time units (forms its own convoy)

Input:
target = 100
positions = [0, 2, 4]
speeds = [4, 2, 1]
Output: 1
Explanation: All vehicles eventually form a single convoy behind the slowest vehicle.
